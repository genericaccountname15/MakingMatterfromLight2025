==============================

ElectronBeams.Zip
------------------------------
Contains the electron data used used for generating figure 3 (a). Separated into folders for dataset A and B, each file is a single shot taken from the electron spectrometer and transformed so that it contains a 2D map of the electron charge, as a function of beam divergence and spectral energy.

GammaProfile.zip
------------------------------
Contains the raw images from the Gamma profile diagnostic for each shot in the null series, i.e., used to generate data shown in figure 4 (a) and the beam charge dependency of figure 11.

GammaSpectra.zip
------------------------------
Contains data from the Gamma spectrometer, i.e., used to generate data shown in figure 4 (b). There are two subfolders corresponding to the data for Datasets A and B, each containing the raw gamma spectrometer CCD images and a .mat file with the fitted spectra for each shot.

SPDS.zip
------------------------------
Raw and processed data for the Single Particle Detectors (SPDs).
The /CsI/ subfolder contains raw camera images from the CsI SPD for various data series.
The /TimePix3/ subfolder contains data for the TimePix3 SPD. Both raw readout data for any given day, and the processed matrix information as a text file and png image, split by the various shot series. Note the labelling that G10-W0018 is the 300 micron thick detector, and F01-W0005 is the 150 micron detector.
The SPD results have been collated in /SPDS/ProcessedSPDResults.xlsx for easier access, and details on how date/run/# correlate for the different shot series.

XrayBath.zip
------------------------------
Contains data from the x-ray crystal spectrometer, i.e., used to generate data shown in figure 5 (a).  Each pickle file contains a single processed shot. A readme in this folder details the variables given.
Also contains the raw shot data used to generate data shown in figure 5 (b), i.e., an example image from the x-ray pinhole camera.
